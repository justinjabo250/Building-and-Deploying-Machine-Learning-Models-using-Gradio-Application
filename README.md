# Building and Deploying a Machine Learning Models Using Gradio Application.

![Screenshot (153)](https://github.com/ikoghoemmanuell/gradio-classification-app/assets/102419217/7394058d-ca91-40fe-b444-f44b426581b9)

# Introduction

With the help of the free and open-source Gradio Python library, you can deploy your machine learning models without having to develop a full web application.

In this project, Gradio will be used to create and deploy a machine learning model.

We'll make use of a dataset that details client turnover for a telecommunications business. Our objective is to create a model that can foretell if a consumer is going to leave or not. After that, we'll build a Gradio interface that enables users to enter customer information and obtain a churn estimate.


# üìÅ Dataset

Public dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn


## Installation

You have two ways in order to setup and run this project.


# üöÄ Setup

Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally.

You need to have [`Python3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system. Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's root (`root :: repo_name> ...`) follow the steps below:

- Windows:

```python
python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt
```

- Linux & MacOs:

```python
python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt
```

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol **;** but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.

- Run the demo apps (being at the repository root):
        
  Gradio:
    
    - Demo

          python gradio_project/basic_demo/app.py

    - Salary prediction

          python gradio_project/salary/app.py

    - Titanic survival prediction

          python gradio_project/titanic/app.py   


  - Go to your browser at the following address :
        
      http://127.0.0.1:7860/


  Streamlit: 

      streamlit run streamlit_project/basic_demo/app.py

  - Go to your browser at the following address :
        
      http://localhost:8501

# üîß Building the Gradio App

We will use the Gradio library to create the app. The app will have input components such as dropdowns, sliders, and radio buttons. These components take in user input and store them as variables. We will also define an output component, which displays the churn prediction generated by the machine learning model.

# üöÄ Execution

To Run the app: Start the Gradio app by calling the launch() method on the Gradio interface object.

```python
iface.launch(inbrowser= True, show_error= True)
```

This will launch a local web server and open a browser window with the Gradio interface. Then you just click on run and you're good to go.

## Resources
Here are some ressources you would read to have a good understanding of Gradio and Streamlit :
- [Get started with Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/create-an-app)

- [Get started with Gradio](https://gradio.app/getting_started/)


# ‚ú® Conclusion

We have now built a Gradio app that predicts customer churn using machine learning. The app is simple to use and can be easily deployed to the cloud or integrated into a web application.
